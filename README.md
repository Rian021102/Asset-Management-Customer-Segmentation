# Asset-Management-Customer-Segmentation

## Project Description
In this project I do two things:
  - Analyze and draw insight of mutual funds app users' using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Make users' segmentation of mutual funds app based on their gender, occupation, income range and type of mutual funds they prefer

## Problem Background
An Indonesian investment platform startup currently is focussing on a mutual fund app. On the application, people can register as user and invest in funds such as, Money Market, Fixed Income, Mixed and Stock Funds. The application also records transaction of both buying and selling funds as well as record the Asset Under Management (AUM) and invested amount of each funds. The startup also expands its business to include offering government bonds. In the upcoming month, the startup wants to offer a newly issued government bonds but the budget only enough for 30% of its users. The marketing team wants to do a marketing campaign that tailored based on the characteristic of the users. Hence they need a customer segmentation based on users' age, occupation, range of salary and type of funds they prefer. The users' segmentation then will be used by marketing team to tailor the right advertorial theme to offer the newley issued government bonds.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
  - Draw insight from data to better understand the users demographic who use this mutual fund app using EDA
  - Make users segmentation using K-Means to cluster users based on their common traits
