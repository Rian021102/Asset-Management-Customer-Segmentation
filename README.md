# Asset-Management-Customer-Segmentation
##Problem Background
An Indonesian investment platform startup currently is focussing on a mutual fund app. On the application, people can register as user and invest in funds namely, Money Market, Fixed Income, Mixed and Stock Funds. The application also records transaction of both buying and selling funds as well as record the Asset Under Management (AUM) and invested amount of each funds. The startup also expands its business to include offering government bonds. In the upcoming month, the startup wants to offer a newly issued government bonds but the budget only enough for 30% of its users. The marketing team wants to do a marketing campaign that tailored based on the characteristic of the users. Hence they need a customer segmentation based on users' age, occupation, range of salary and type of funds they prefer. The users' segmentation then will be used by marketing team to tailor the right advertorial theme to offer the newley issued government bonds.

In the context of customer segmentation for asset management, k-means is a clustering algorithm that can be used to group customers into distinct clusters based on certain characteristics or attributes. This can be useful for asset managers who want to better understand their customer base and tailor their products or services to specific segments of customers.

To use k-means for customer segmentation, you would first need to gather data on your customers, such as their age, income, investment preferences, and any other relevant attributes. You would then use this data to train the k-means algorithm, which will identify patterns in the data and group similar customers together into clusters.

Once the algorithm has identified the clusters, you can analyze each cluster to understand the characteristics and needs of the customers within it. This can help you tailor your marketing efforts, investment strategies, and other aspects of your asset management business to better serve each customer segment.

Overall, using k-means for customer segmentation can help asset managers better understand and serve their customers, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

As for the decision number of cluster, I'm using both the elbow method and Sillhoute Plot to determine number of cluster. The elbow method and silhouette plots are two techniques that can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters for a k-means clustering analysis. Both methods can be useful for finding the "right" number of clusters to use in a particular analysis, as choosing the wrong number of clusters can lead to suboptimal results.
